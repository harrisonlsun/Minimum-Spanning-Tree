### Minimum-Spanning-Tree
-------------------------
This program explores 4 approaches to minimum spanning trees. It finds the minimum distance between the first node and each of the other nodes using the following approaches:  
- Prim's Algorithm with Adjacency Matrix  
- Prim's Algorithm with Adjacency List  
- Dijkstra's Algorithm  
- Bellman-Ford's Algorithm  

This program generates arbitary positive weights and outputs an output formatted as follows:
