 * This file contains the main function for the program. The program runs Prim's Algorithm using two methods: adjacency matrix with unsorted array for priority queue and adjacency list with binary heap for priority queue.
 * The program also implements Djikstra's Algorithm using adjacency matrix with unsorted array for priority queue and the Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
